Q2:
	RIP response from router2:
	Here, the metric indicates the amount of hops to get to the destination.
	It can reach the network 10.2.4.0 in Metric=1, since the network is
	incident on router2.
	It can reach the network 10.3.40 in Metric=2, as the network is not
	incident on router2.
	It can reach its own host and loopback address in Metric=1.
	It can reach the host and loopback address of router4 in Metric=2.

Q3:
	host1 traceroute 192.168.3.13 -n (host3).
	It first reaches the gateway 192.168.1.1, which connects the host to router1.
	Then it reaches gateway 10.1.3.3 of router3.
	Then it finally arrives at host3 (192.168.3.13.

Q4:
	host1 traceroute 192.168.3.13 -n (host3).
	It first reaches the gateway connecting host1 to router1 (192.168.1.1).
	Then it is sent through the switch (network 10.1.4.0) to gateway 10.1.4.4 of router4.
	Then it reaches gateway 10.3.4.3 of router3.
	And then it finally arrives at host3.

Q5:
	it loses 8 packets while the link is down
	so 8*6 ms = 48 ms (56 ms ?)

Q6:
	(no change?)

Q7:
	It does not recover. This is because the switch is unable to send RIP messages back
	indicating that it has lost the connection to router1.

Q8:
	When disconnecting router4 from the switch, router4 knows that it is
	unable to reach router1 the usual route. It reconnects shortly after.

Q9:
